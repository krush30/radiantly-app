### Project Overview

1. **Technologies Used:** Redux Toolkit, REST API, and Tailwind CSS.
2. **API Fetching:** I created a custom hook for fetching data, allowing easy access from any component.
3. **State Management:** Used Redux Toolkit to store the API data, enabling selection of reducers across different files.
4. **Challenges:** The main roadblock was implementing images, as the provided API links were not functional.
